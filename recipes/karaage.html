    <h2>For the talk</h2>
    <p>Karaage is a Japanese cooking technique in which various foods—most often chicken, but also other meat and fish—are deep fried in oil. The process involves lightly coating small pieces of the meat or fish with flour, or potato or corn starch, and frying in a light oil. The foods are marinated prior to coating. The process differs from the preparation of tempura, which is not marinated and uses a batter for coating. Karaage is often served alone or with rice and shredded cabbage.</p>
    <p>Karaage is often cited to have been popularized in the 1920s by the Toyoken restaurant in Beppu, Japan. The method was popularized because of the food shortages in Japan after World War II, specifically for chicken. Chicken was already a popular meal, but using the Karaage method made it easier to cook, and provided a different way to eat chicken.</p>
