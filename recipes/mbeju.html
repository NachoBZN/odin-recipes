    <h2>For the talk</h2>
    <p>The mbejú is a kind of pancake made from cassava starch and fresh cheese. It is inherited from the Cario Guaraní-Spanish mestizo cuisine and is traditional from the gastronomy of Paraguay.</p>
    <p>The name “mbejú” is a Guaraní word that means “crushed cake”. The mbejú is linked to the Guaraní mythology, being, consequently, one of the oldest recipes of this culture. Along with the chipa and the Paraguayan soup, it is part of the set of foods called týra. "Týra" is a Guarani term that designates all food that is consumed to accompany cooked mate, milk, tea, coffee, etc. Since ancient times, there were at least 16 different preparations that made up the set of foods called "týra". At present, 11 of them have been identified.</p>
