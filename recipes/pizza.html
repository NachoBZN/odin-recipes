    <h2>For the talk</h2>
    <p>Pan pizza is a pizza baked in a deep dish pan. The bottoms and sides of the crust become fried and crispy in the oil used to coat the pan. Chicago and Detroit-style pizza may be considered a form of pan pizza. Pan pizza generally refers to the thick style popularized by Pizza Hut in the 1960s.</p>
    <p>Dan and Frank Carney opened a pizza parlor in Wichita, Kansas which would later become Pizza Hut. At first, the brothers focused on a thin crust pizza which included cheese, pepperoni, and/or sausage. The pizza parlor franchised into Pizza Hut in 1959 and added a thicker crust pan pizza.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>514 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>11 grams kosher salt</li>
        <li>3 grams quick rise yeast</li>
        <li>125 ml olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>350 ml warm water</li>
        <li>250 ml tomato sauce</li>
        <li>313 grams shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>60 grams sliced pepperoni</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the dough: Mix the flour, salt, and yeast in a large bowl. Stir in 3 tablespoons olive oil, then add in the water and mix until a shaggy dough forms. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until a smooth ball forms.</li>
        <li>Pour the remaining oil on a baking sheet. Place the dough in the centre of the baking sheet and rub with a little bit of oil. Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm spot until the dough has doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Heat the oven to 450Â°F. Use your fingertips to gently stretch the dough to fill the length and width of the pan.</li>
        <li>Spoon tomato sauce on the dough leaving a 1-inch border around the edges. Sprinkle cheese over sauce then arrange pepperoni on top. Bake in the oven until the cheese is bubbling, about 20 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
